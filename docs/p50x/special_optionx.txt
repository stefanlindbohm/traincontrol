Intellibox: Special Options (SO)
(document version 0.41 - 07/99) - by St.Ch-B.
=============================================

The Intellibox uses up to 1000 Special Options (SO), numbered from 0 to 999.
These are modifiable by the user only through the Intellibox menus, not by PC
(see also XSOSet command) - however, the PC can read the value of all SO's.
Each SO controls a particular aspect of the Intellibox configuration.
This document lists some of these 1000 SO's, along with their 'meaning'.

Only some SO's are documented. These would be the 'main' SO's, i.e. those
which would or could make sense being able to modify. Please do NOT change
the value of other SO's as this could interfere or even impede correct
Intellibox operation.

A maximum and a minimum value are internally associated with each SO.
The Intellibox does not allow selecting a value outside that range.


*** SO #1 (factory default = 0) - min = 0, max = 4
Intellibox default power-on Baudrate.
0 = 2400 bps
1 = 4800 bps
2 = 9600 bps
3 = 19200 bps
4 = 38400 bps


*** SO #2 (factory default = 0) - min = 0, max = 2
Intellibox default power-on RS-232 protocol.
0 = P50 only
1 = P50X only
2 = both P50 and P50X


*** SO #4 (factory default = 0) - min = 0, max = 1
CTS line polarity (computer type)
0 = PC (CTS active when at +12V)
1 = Mac (CTS active when at -12V)


*** SO #6 (factory default = 254) - min = 0, max = 255
P5Xa 'RT' cmd default value.
254 would mean: upon a non-PC power off, the CTS line is disabled
for about 13 seconds (254 * 50 ms = 12.7 seconds).
Please check also P50Xa 'RT' cmd documentation.


*** SO #7 (factory default = 88 = ASCII 'X') - min = 80, max = 95
Default P50X cmds leading character (when in mixed P50/P50X mode).


*** SO #8 (factory default = 16) - min = 0, max = 62
Number of s88 'half-modules' to be automatically read by the Intellibox.


*** SO #10 (factory default = 1) - min = 0, max = 8
Default Lok protocol
0 = Motorola Old
1 = Motorola New
2 = DCC: 14
3 = DCC: 27
4 = DCC: 28
5 = DCC: 28 DAC
6 = DCC: 128
7 = DCC: 128 DAC
8 = Selectrix
9 = ZZZ


*** SO #11 (factory default = 50) - min = 30, max = 100
How long, in 50 ms units, the Stop and Go keys must be held pressed
before an Intellibox reset (warmstart) is performed.
The default corresponds to 2.5 seconds.


*** SO #12 (factory default = 0) - min = 0, max = 1
Default Turnout protocol
0 = Motorola
1 = DCC


*** SO #13 (factory default = 2) - min = 0, max = 255
Minimum Turnout 'on' time in 50 ms units.
A value of 0 turns minimum 'on' time checking off.


*** SO #14 (factory default = 100) - min = 0, max = 255
Maximum Turnout 'on' time in 50 ms units.
A value of 0 turns maximum 'on' time checking off.


*** SO #15 (factory default = 1) - min = 0, max = 1
Whether (0) or not (1) to limit the Intellibox maximum voltage
output. Shown as "N scale" (0) or "H0 scale" (1) by the Intellibox.


*** SO #16 (factory default = 1) - min = 0, max = 1
Programming Track mode (i.e. relay control)
0 = PT only (relay always 'on')
1 = automatic (relay 'on' only during PT mode or if explicitly
    commanded 'on' by PC)
When the PT relay is 'on' the Intellibox PT output is internally
disconnected from the normal power output and internally connected to
the Intellibox PT circuitry.


*** SO #19 (factory default = 0) - min = 0, max = 2
Whether to restore Lok status upon turning on the Intellibox and what
eventually to restore:
0 = no restore
1 = restore Function, Dir, F1..F4, but set Speed = 0
2 = restore Function, Dir, F1..F4 and Speed
In case 1 and 2, also eventual consists (multi-tractions) are restored.


*** SO #20 (factory default = 1) - min = 0, max = 1
Whether (1) or not (0) P50 commands to an already 'busy' Lok are
allowed ('busy' = already controlled by another (non-PC) device).


*** SO #21 (factory default = 0) - min = 0, max = 1
Whether (1) or not (0) to discard P50 turnout commands issued while
the Intellibox is in Power Off.


*** SO #23 (factory default = 1) - min = 0, max = 62
s88 'half-module' number which is the source for the s88 Timers.
(0 = s88 Timers are disabled).


*** SO #24 (factory default = 1) - min = 0, max = 62
s88 'half-module' number which is the source for the s88 Counters.
(0 = s88 Counters are disabled).


*** SO #25 (factory default = 1) - min = 0, max = 1
Whether (1) or not (0) to always send a DCC signal - eventually a DCC
idle signal (if there is no DCC Lok in the refresh cycle).


*** SO #26 (factory default = 1) - min = 0, max = 1
Whether (1) or not (0) a PC Break (RS-232) forces 2400 bps.


*** SO #800 (factory default = 13) - min = 0, max = 13
LCD backlight level.


*** SO #801 (factory default = 0) - min = 0, max = 100
LCD contrast voltage level (0 = about 0V, 100 = about 5V).


*** SO #802 (factory default = 4) - min = 0, max = 6
Intellibox panel LED's dimming factor (excluding Stop and Go LED's).
A higher value reduces LED's brightness.


*** SO #803 (factory default = 0) - min = 0, max = 7
Currently selected language for Intellibox LCD messages.
0 = de, 1 = uk, 2 = fr, 3 = it, 4 = nl, 5 = se, 6 = es, 7 = pt


*** SO #808 (factory default = 0) - min = 0, max = 1
AC (0) or DC (1) style speed knobs.


*** SO #809 (factory default = 0) - min = 0, max = 1
Absolute (0) or Percentage (1) speed display.


*** SO #810 (factory default = 1) - min = 0, max = 255
Default turnout address (after turning on the Intellibox) to be controlled
through the first Intellibox key-pair devoted to turnout control while in
Keyboard mode (keys [1] (red) and [4] (green)).
The allowed range is 0..255, with 0 having a special meaning: it activates
a special Keyboard mode - known as "table Keyboard mode".
During this mode, each turnout control key-pair is associated with a
user-defineable turnout address.
The first turnout address is taken from the value of SO #871 incremented by 1.
The second from SO #872 +1, 3rd SO #873 +1, 4th SO #874 +1, 5th SO #875 +1,
6th SO #876 +1, 7th SO #877 +1 and the eigth turnout address is taken from
SO #878 +1.
For example: setting SO #871 to the value 10 would allow you to control the
turnout address 11 through the [1] and [4] key-pair (of course: only if this
"table Keyboard mode" has been activated!).
The activation of this special mode can also be done 'on the fly', by
choosing 0 as keyboard (base) address in the keyboard menu.
The factory default for SO #871..878 allows controlling turnouts:
11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71 and 81.


*** SO #812 (factory default = 1) - min = 1, max = 128
Default s88 module number to be shown when activating the s88 mode after
turning on the Intellibox.
(s88 module numbers 32..128 only correspond to LocoNet sensors).


*** SO #815 (factory default = 0) - min = 0, max = 2
Default mode to be selected after turning on the Intellibox:
0 = Keyboard, 1 = s88, 2 = programming.


*** SO #901 (factory default = 1) - min = 1, max = 100
This SO has to be changed to a value **slightly** higher than the factory
default one (e.g. 3) in order make it possible to control DCC Loks on layout
sections supplied through a Maerklin Booster 6015 or 6017.
